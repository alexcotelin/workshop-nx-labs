# Lab 2: Throttle Assigned to User Field and Transform

## Time: 20 minutes

## Scenario

While searching is working for users and tickets, we have a performance issue!

![rxjs1 0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/210413/47622033-f1855c80-dacd-11e8-9ec0-1d26a90b3456.jpg)

For each change in the AssignedUsers search criteria, we are thrashing the server:

*  We are not waiting until the user appears to have finished changing the criteria.
*  We are querying the server with possible same query as the most recent, previous query.


Let's fix these **performance issues**!

## Instructions

##### In `search-tickets.component.ts`

1. Use the `pipe` method on the `assignedToUser.valueChanges` observable.
2. Import and use the **`debounceTime`** and **`distinctUntilChanged`** operators for the `assignedToUser` observable... to manage and throttle the user lookup queries. A good suggested debounce time is **500** milliseconds, although feel free to try out different values and see what the user experience is like!
3. Use the **`filter`** operator on `assignedToUser` to only allow value strings with a length greater than zero.
4. Use the **`tap`** operator on `assignedToUser` to set the `users` class field to `null` when the length of `value` is zero.
5. Use `pipe` with the **`map`** operator on the `UserService.users` observable to transform each user object to just the `fullName` property; this is known as *extracting a property value*. Update the `users` class field to be an array of strings and update the template `ngFor` logic for the suggest on type.
  >  Hint: you can use `Array.map()` within the observable `map` operator.

### Investigate

This ^ code works great to manage and control REST server queries.

There is, however, a **bad practice** code implementation here.. ðŸ˜± and an actual super-subtle **race-condition** bug ðŸ˜œ! Be prepared to discuss it! (Don't cheat and look ahead! ðŸ¤—)
